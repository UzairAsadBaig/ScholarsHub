<h1>ScholarsHub</h1>
<p>ScholarsHub is a web application developed during the NasCon23 Web Development Hackathon held by FAST NUCES Islamabad. It is an innovative platform that connects universities, research organizations, and students/researchers from all over the world. The platform provides a centralized location for universities and research organizations to post their available PhD positions, research grants, research engineer positions, Post Doctorate, and other research opportunities. At the same time, Students and Researchers can use the platform to easily search and find the opportunities that match their research interests and expertise.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The lack of a centralized platform for universities and research organizations to post their available PhD positions, research grants, and research engineer positions, combined with the absence of an efficient system to notify interested students and researchers of relevant opportunities, creates a barrier for potential candidates to find and apply for positions that match their qualifications and interests. This results in missed opportunities for both the organizations and the candidates, limiting the potential for academic and research progress. Therefore, there is a need for a web application that can bridge this gap and provide a comprehensive platform for universities and research organizations to advertise their positions while also allowing students and researchers to find and apply for suitable positions with ease.
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>ScholarsHub is the solution to the problem stated above. The platform is not only easy to use, but it also provides helpful features that allow students and researchers to create a personalized profile, receive notifications about newly posted opportunities, and connect with potential supervisors or collaborators. ScholarsHub streamlines the process of discovering and applying for research positions, making it easier for talented individuals to find the right opportunities and contribute to important scientific advancements.</p>
